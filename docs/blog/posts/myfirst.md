# Introduction to Buildspace

I am participating in the 5th season of Buildspace's Nights and Weekends! Read more to find out what all this is about!
<!-- more -->

Last week, I got into Buildspace's Nights and Weekends program (S5). I am very excited about joining this space, meeting with the people, and more importantly working on my passion project.

## What is Buildspace?
Simply put, Buildspace is a 6-week program that you can join to work on whatever interests you - from tech to music to just about anything.

## Why did you join Buildspace?
The program's branding as well as the success stories caught my attention. Upon closer look, the ideas, the vibes, and the intent behind the program and its founders made me want to submit an application and here I am!

## What was the process?
You simply apply on Buildspace detailing various questions on what you want to build. In addition, they have this thing called *sage* which allows you to find people who are working on whatever projects. 

# What will YOU be building?
The main question. Week One is dedicated to ideation and as such, I will dedicate this week to come out with a final idea.

However, I know my focus lies on making tech that makes immigration an easier and better process for many people. 

How successful I am in this - I will only know at the end!
